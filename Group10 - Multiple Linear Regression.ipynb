    "# AI Adoption and Layoffs: new model\n",

    "In this notebook, we extend our previous analysis regarding the relationship between AI adoption and layoffs adding more variables to our regression model in order to control for potential new factors that could influence layoffs. As the previous simple linear regression model states:\n",

    "$$\n",

    "Characteristics such as revenue growth, merger, market capitalization, taxes, foreign direct investments, R&D expences, average age of employees, unionization rate of the firm and concession of public incentives to adopt the AI will be included in the analysis. The goal is to identify which factors are statistically significant and assess the robustness of the relationship between AI adoption and layoffs."

    "## Full Multiple linear regression\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- Let us remember our research question “Does a higher level of AI adoption in firms correlate with a higher number of layoffs?”\n",
    "So far, we have run a linear regression considering the annual number of layoff as Y and AI adoption level by firms as the only explanatory variable X. \n",
    "As we reported in our conclusions, extending the model by including new variables might be a good way to improve our model and making it more informative.\n",
    "Therefore, we specify a new linear regression, but this time i twill be a multiple linear regression: -->\n",
    "The new variables we decided to include are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Revenue growth** in one year $X_2$: this it to account for the fact that a decrease in revenue might imply less resources available and therefore possible layoffs. An increase in $X_2$ has a negative effect on $\\text{Layoffs}$.\n",
    "- **Merger** $X_3$: a variable =1 if the firm has been acquired by another firm in the last year and zero otherwise. This is to account for the fact that mergers and acquisition often imply a dismissal of many employers of the acquired company, who are substituted by staff selected by the acquiring company. If $X_3=1$, $\\text{Layoffs}$ increases.\n",
    "- **Market capitalization** $X_4$: a variable that describes the total value of outstanding shares of a firm. We believe that less capitalized firms might have less employees and therefore they could be less inclined to fire them. An increase in $X_4$ has a positive effect on $\\text{Layoffs}$.\n",
    "- **Taxes**: the amount of taxes $X_5$: paid in the last year. Higher level of taxes might reduce legal reserves of a company or, more generally, reduce the resources that can be invested for priority projects. Therefore, higher layoffs are more likely to occur to compensate the higher taxes. An increase in $X_5$ has a positive effect on $\\text{Layoffs}$.\n",
    "- **Foreign direct investments** $X_6$: investments in another country to acquire a significant influence on a foreign firm or to establish a new subsidiary. FDIs can imply investments in new production facilities, maybe less expensive than the ones in home country, which might be closed. An increase in $X_6$ has a positive effect on $\\text{Layoffs}$.\n",
    "- **R&D expenses** $X_7$: firms with higher R&D expenses might tend to reskill employees and adapt their competences to make them compatible with AI tools, rather than firing them. An increase in $X_7$ has a negative effect on $\\text{Layoffs}$.\n",
    "- **Average age of employees** $X_8$: we believe that employees with higher average age might be less likely to gladly accept to attend training courses in order to be reskilled. An increase in $X_8$ has a positive effect on $\\text{Layoffs}$.\n",
    "- **Unionization rate of the firm** $X_9$: with a higher level of unionization , layoffs would be likely lower. An increase in $X_9$ has a negative effect on $\\text{Layoffs}$.\n",
    "- **Concession of public incentives to adopt the AI** (binary variable) $X_{10}$: if a firm receives incentives in order to adopt AI tools, then this process might accelerate the process of AI adoption and increase the number of layoffs. If $X_{10}=1$, $\\text{Layoffs}$ increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dependent variable $\\text{Layoffs}$ is simulated as a linear function of these predictors plus a random noise term. We then estimate a multiple linear regression model using the ordinary least squares (OLS) method with $\\text{Layoffs}$ as the dependent variable:\n",

    "## Restricted model\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the regression contains a relatively high number of variables, we believe that, by running a regression output sono betas might be statistically non-different from zero and therefore some variables can be eliminated, so that we can consider a third linear regression model. According to us, the variable in question are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Foreign direct investments** $X_6$: as a matter of fact, they can be used simply to expand the presence of the firm in another country and it does not necessarily imply shutdown of production plans.\n",
    "- **Taxes** $X_5$: we believe that the reason we proposed before to include it in the model is appropriate, but in most cases higher level of taxes in one year might not be sufficient do determine a significant increase in the number of layoffs. Moreover, taxes can increase due to an increase in revenues, and if revenues increase , firing workforce should not be necessary.\n",
    "- **Concession of public incentives to adopt AI** $X_{10}$: incentives can accelerate AI adoption and workforce might be fired. However, if a firm does not directly pay for AI tools then cutting cost could be non- necessary, at least in the short term. Therfore workforce and AI tools might be complementary and the number of layoffs will not increase.\n",
    "- **Average age of employees** $X_8$: we believe that it is true that old workers might be less willing to adapt to AI, but in practice firms generally tend to fire young workers, rather than old employees.\n",

    "We prefere the restricted model, as it is more parsimonious and easier to interpret. It is more complete than the single linear regression model done in the first work, as it includes more variables that might influence layoffs, but at the same time it avoids including variables that are not significant in contrast to the full model."
