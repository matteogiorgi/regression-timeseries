This work analysed the determinants of residential property prices in Ames (Iowa) using the Ames Housing Dataset, which provides a rich and heterogeneous set of structural, qualitative and locational characteristics for nearly 3,000 properties sold between 2006 and 2010. Our objective was to identify which features have a statistically and economically significant impact on sale prices, and to construct a regression model consistent with the assumptions of the classical linear model.
 Summary of Empirical Findings 
Our baseline specification (a multiple linear regression including structural size variables, quality measures, and neighbourhood indicators) exhibited a high explanatory power, with an adjusted R2 of about 0.85. In particular: 
 • Size and structural attributes such as GrLivArea, TotalBsmtSF, and LotArea display strong and significant effects on prices. Above-ground living area emerges as one of the strongest continuous predictors.
• Quality indicators, notably OverallQual, KitchenQual, ExterQual, and BsmtQual, play a decisive role. Lower-quality categories consistently carry substantial price discounts relative to top-quality units. 
• Construction and renovation year (YearBuilt and YearRemodAdd) contribute positively and significantly, reflecting depreciation effects and the value buyers assign to modernized structures. 
• Neighbourhood remains a powerful determinant even in fully specified models, confirming the importance of locational amenities, socio-economic characteristics, and spatial desirability. 
Diagnostic Analysis and Model Adequacy 
A complete set of diagnostic tests was conducted to assess the validity of our specification: Perfect collinearity was not present in our specification, however we would like to inform the reader that a case of perfect collineartity can be found in the Ames dataset, therefore the choice of regressors has to be carefully implemented, otherwhise it will be impossible to compute OLS estimators. In the dataset we find perfect collinearity when including all area components (GrLivArea, FirstFlrSF, SecondFlrSF, LowQualFinSF) simultaneously, since Ground Living Area represents the total above-ground living area of a house and the other components represents the living area of single floors and above-ground rooms. This issue disappears when any one of the dependent variables is excluded. We remark that R removes one of the collinear variables automatically (LowQualFinSf in our case).
• Imperfect multicollinearity was evaluated using VIF and GVIF indices. After proper transformation of categorical variables, none of the regressors exhibited problematic values, that is a VIF superior to 10,  the common threshold for detecting potential near collinearity. We therefore ruled out near-collinearity as a major source of estimation distortion. Therefore, the variance of our estimators will not be inflated by multicollinearity, our standard errors will not increase due to this issue and we will not have to deal with wider confidence intervals, less informative hypothesis tests and less precise inference in general.
As we know, structural stability can be tested by mean of a Chow test, in order to see if the relationship between the explanatory variables and the dependent variable remained constant over time . Our data consider houses sold from 2006 to 2010 and we used as a breakpoint 2008, the year associated with the Global Financial Crisis, an important event which might have had an impact on the relationship between explanatory variables and the dependent one The test provided no evidence of a structural break: the pricing mechanism appears stable over time. Despite this might seem counter-intuitive, the intercept shifts downward in post-crisis years. This suggests that the crisis affected the level of prices but not the structure of price determination: therefore our estimated model is coherent all over the considered time span.








Functional form misspecification emerged as the most relevant issue: the RESET test rejected the null hypothesis at the 1% significance level for both the baseline linear model and the log-linear variant. This indicates that relevant nonlinearities or omitted interactions were missing in the original specification. 
Our final Model was therefore constructed by: applying log-transformations to SalePrice and key continuous regressors, treating quality variables as ordered factors to capture nonlinear differences across quality levels, and by introducing an economically meaningful interaction (GrLivArea × OverallQual) which considers the fact that a large low-quality house might be less worthy than a small high-quality house, an important economic interpretation that the previous model was not able to capture at all. Moreover the log–log specification, allows to interpret the coefficient of the variables as elasticities (percentage change in price associated with percentage change in the regressors) and to capture diminishing marginal effects of the regressors with respect to the dependent variable.  This enriched specification successfully passed the RESET test, indicating a correct functional form.
Using this new estimated model, heteroskedasticity was strongly detected via the White test, the most appropriate test for cross-sectional data.  As a solution, we adopted HAC robust standard errors to ensure reliable inference. 
Our idea of transforming our cross-sectional dataset into a smaller dataset with same houses sold in different years, in order to have a more classical and precise interpretation of the Durbin Watson test, could not be practically implemented since apparently no house in the dataset was sold more than once in the time span considered. 
For completeness, we calculated the Durbin Watson anyway and we affirm that autocorrelation of residuals was not present. We also calculated the Jarque Bera test for the normality of the residuals which rejects the null hypothesis and concludes that residuals are not normally distributed. However, we do not think this represents a problem since we did not assume any particular distribution for the residuals.

.Overall Assessment In conclusion, the modelling exercise demonstrates that: • house prices in Ames are primarily driven by a combination of structural size, overall and specific quality indicators, and neighbourhood attributes; • nonlinear relationships and interactions are essential to correctly capture the economic mechanisms behind property valuation; • the refined specification provides a flexible, statistically sound and economically interpretable model; • the 2008 financial crisis did not alter the structural relationship between housing attributes and prices, but did affect the absolute level of prices. The final model therefore offers a robust and insightful representation of the housing market in Ames, and lays the groundwork for potential extensions such as spatial econometric models, non-parametric approaches, or regularized regression methods for high-dimensional settings.
